# 1.      Write a program to demonstrate basic data type in python. (Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Set, Frozenset, Bool, Mutable and Immutable.)

# 1)     Execute following instructions.

# a = 5
# print("Type of a: ", type(a))
# b = 5.0
# print("\nType of b: ", type(b))
# c = 2 + 4j
# print("\nType of c: ", type(c))

# print(5==5)
# print(5>6)

# 2)     Write a program using a while loop that asks the user for a number, and prints a countdown from that number to zero.

# 3)     Write a program that asks the user for their name and how many times to print it. The program should print out the userâ€™s name the specified number of times.

# 4)     create a dictionary var for a book information and display.

# 5)     Perform various operations on a list. (eg- sort, pop, remove, append, extend, del etc.)

# 6)     Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out the sine, cosine, and

# tangent of that number.

# 7)     Write a program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should then print the following:

# (a) The total number of characters in the string

# (b) The string repeated 10 times

# (c) The first character of the string (remember that string indices start at 0)

# (d) The first three characters of the string

# (e) The last three characters of the string

# (f) The string backwards

# (g) The seventh character of the string if the string is long enough and a message otherwise

# (h) The string with its first and last characters removed

# (i) The string in all caps

# (j) The string with every a replaced with an e

# (k) The string with every letter replaced by a space

# 8) Write a program that asks the user to enter a word and prints out whether that word contains any vowels

# 9) Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of integers. Do the following:

# (a) Print the total number of items in the list.

# (b) Print the last item in the list.

# (c) Print the list in reverse order.

# (d) Print Yes if the list contains a 5 and No otherwise.

# (e) Print the number of fives in the list.

# (f) Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the

# result.

# (g) Print how many integers in the list are less than 5.

# 10 )  Create dictionary for words and counts in file.
